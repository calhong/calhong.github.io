Hi I'm Calvin! I'm a third-year Combined Business and Computer Science Major at the University of British Columbia, currently enrolled in the [BUCS Program.](https://mybcom.sauder.ubc.ca/bucs)

<p>I love to build things. From my first computer at 9 years old, to the software that I'm building today, finding ways to make things work together is something that I love to do. I was introduced to coding and software development when I was 18, and after the first program I built, I was hooked.</p>

<p>My focus over the last few months have been dedicated to building solutions to help people simplify their days with minimal thought required. It's more than just building things that can do the task, the experience matters too. If the way to use the solution is too dificult to understand, then it was never a solution to begin with.</p>

<b>I'm currently open to 2021 internships/co-ops in software development. Reach out on any platform, and let's talk!</b>
